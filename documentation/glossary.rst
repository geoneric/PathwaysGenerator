      Actions do not change often and are often used in multiple :term:`studies <study>`. Within
      a single study, actions are often part of multiple :term:`sequences <sequence>`.

      Examples:

      - Raise river embankment by `x` cm.
      - Room for the rivers by `x` ha.

   sequence
   action sequence
      A sequence of :term:`actions <action>`. Certain sequences can be useful in multiple
      :term:`studies <study>`.

      Examples:

   scenario
      Some condition that changes over time resulting in negative effects on the environment,
      including us. A :term:`pathways study <study>` helps to analyse possible ways to mitigate
      these effects. Scenarios can be used in multiple projects. A scenario is encoded as a
      time series.

      Examples:

      - Sea level rise.
      - The discharge of the Rhine increases with `x` m³ / sec per year.

   tipping point
      A moment in time or a condition that will render an :term:`action` or a :term:`sequence
      of actions <sequence>` as ineffective. Tipping points are unique per :term:`study`. Under the
      same scenario and applying the same actions often different tipping points have to be used,
      when applied to different regions of the world.

      Examples:

      - A certain embankment collapses when the discharge becomes higher than `x` m³ / sec.

   pathway
   adaptation pathway
      A combination of a :term:`sequence <sequence>`, a :term:`scenario <scenario>`, and
      :term:`tipping points <tipping point>`. Pathways are unique for a :term:`study`.
      Pathways can be visualized as :term:`pathway maps <pathway map>`.

   adaptation pathway study
      A study is an analysis of a set of :term:`adaptation pathways <pathway>`. This
      involves defining :term:`actions <action>`, combining them into multiple :term:`sequences
      <sequence>`, and adding information about a :term:`scenario` and :term:`tipping points
      <tipping point>`. This allows the pathways to be compared. Depending on the functionality
      of the pathway analysis software, various metrics can be calculated to aid in the comparison.
