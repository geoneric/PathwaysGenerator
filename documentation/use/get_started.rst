Get started
===========

Here, we assume that you want to get started using the ``adaptation_pathways`` Python package
distributed as a so-called Python Wheel.

The ``adaptation_pathways`` Python package can be used by performing these steps in turn:

#. Create and activate a new virtual environment. There are multiple options for this. Below
   we show how to setup a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv module and using Conda.
#. Install all required Python packages
#. Use the software
#. Remove the virtual environment

This procedure will leave no traces on your computer. If you intent to use the software regularly,
you can keep the virtual environment as is, and install any updated versions of the software later.


Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

Python's built-in venv module and Conda (and others) are alternatives with which you can
achieve the same thing: create one or more virtual environments to install Python packages in.
You don't need to use Python's venv module if you work with Conda, and vice versa.

In the examples below, a virtual environment called ap_test is created. You can of course pick any
other name for the environment.


Using venv
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_
* `Documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ... # prefix of some directory for storing virtual environment
   python3 -m venv ap_test
   # Use Scripts instead of bin if you use Windows
   source ap_test/bin/activate
   pip3 install --upgrade pip


Using Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Using pip in a Conda environment <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#pip-in-env>`_

.. code-block:: bash

   # Python version must be >= 3.9
   conda create --name ap_test python=3.12
   conda activate ap_test


Install packages
----------------

The software is packaged as a Python wheel file. The pip command can be used to install it.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ... # prefix of dist directory containing package(s)
   pip3 install -f dist adaptation_pathways


Use software
------------

Once the software is installed correctly, the following should work:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Use an installed script
   ap_plot_pathway_map --help

   # Use the package
   python3 -c "import adaptation_pathways as ap; print(ap.__version__)"


Upgrade software
----------------

Installing an updated version of the software can be done using this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install upgrade -f dist adaptation_pathways


Remove virtual environment
--------------------------

Using venv
~~~~~~~~~~

Just remove the ap_test directory containing the virtual environment.


Using Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the Conda command to remove the virtual environment and all packages installed in it.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda deactivate
   conda env remote --name ap_test
